\chapter{Introduction} \label{introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This document is Requirement Analysis and Specification Document(RASD). The main purpose of this document is the following points
\begin{itemize}
	\item Communicates an understanding of the requirements to the audience and explains both the application domain and the system to be developed.
	\item Contractual: Make this project formal and written so that it has legal effect.
	\item As the baseline for project planning and estimation. i.e. size, cost, schedule. 
	\item As the baseline for software evaluation
		\subitem It can support system testing, verification and validation activities
		\subitem It should contain enough information to verify whether the delivered system meets requirements
	\item As the baseline for change control, such as requirements change, software evolves.
\end{itemize}
And this RASD has the following intended audiences
\begin{itemize}
	\item Costumers \& Users : Some user may interest in validating system goals and high-level description of functionalities.
	\item Systems and Requirements Analysts: The RASD may help them to write various specifications of other systems that inter-relate.
	\item Developers, Programmers: The RASD may help the to implement the requirements
	\item Testers: The RASD may help the to determine that the requirements have been met
	\item Project Managers: The RASD may help them to measure and control the analysis and development processes
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
\subsection{Description of the given problem}

At the end of 2019, a global epidemic broke out, swept almost all countries in the world in a few months, starting in 2020, people's life rhythm has been completely disrupted by this epidemic, a lot of cities are blocked, people are allowed to exit their homes only for essential needs, all had to wear masks and respect the social-distancing at least 1.5 m. In the public area, the human community has to take measures to avoid the crazy spread of the virus, restaurant began to use dividers separate the tables, supermarkets and museums began to restrict flow, the school also adopted two classes mode online and onsite.

In this context, a new problem arises, how to delay the spread of the virus through technical means? 

Since grocery shopping is the most needed activity under the lock-down, so let’s narrow the problem to grocery shopping.

In the supermarket, In order to meet these strict rules, many challenges have arisen, so, we can turn to technology, in particular to software applications, to help navigate the challenges created by the imposed restrictions.

So, this project appeared - Customers Line-up(CLup).


Customers Line-up(CLup) is an easy-to-use application, it has two main goals. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item  First of all, the CLup have to allow store managers to regulate the influx of people in the building.
	\item  And then, it will saves people from having to line up and stand outside of stores for hours on end.	
\end{itemize}
